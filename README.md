<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The explosive growth of cryptocurrency prices in recent years has piqued the interest of many investors, both retail and institutional. Although individual cryptocurrencies can be purchased directly through an exchange, new crypto-related investment opportunities are becoming available in the market, such as Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).

This app allows the user to select stocks, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies over time to view price performance over time. The app also offers a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast future performance, where the user can change the allocation of their portfolio.

The S&P 500 (SPY) will be used as a baseline throughout the entire application.

Investors will be able to use this application, with it's vizualization tools, to make decisions that are best aligned to their individual investment goals.

# Usage

As a user, I want to learn about how the performance of newly created Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) compares to the performance of the S&P 500 and individual cryptocurrencies.

To use the Crypto ETF app, the user must input their initial investment, stock ticker, cryptocurrency, portfolio allocation, and number of years to simulate. The app then calls for data via API and renders plots for the user to review.



The following are investment options available to the user(s) against the S&P 500 (SPY).

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
Hit Return for more, or q (and Return) to quit: 
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
Hit Return for more, or q (and Return) to quit: 
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.
